# Graphics
Program about adding 'points' and 'lines' in a .csv and show them graphically using *Python*
(the **colored** library is used to add color and format to the characters of the terminal)

The things you can do are:

- Add a POINT (example: Point B, 3, 6)
- Add a LINE (example: Line A, D)

- See all the points 
- See a single point 
- See all the points and lines write

- CLEAR the points data base or the lines data base

The information is stored in the file *databasePoints.csv* thus:

| Punto | coord_x | coord_y |
|-------|---------|---------|
| A     | 4       | 8       |
| B     | 2       | 1       |
| ...   | ...     | ...     |


The information is stored in the file *databaseLines.csv* thus:

| Punto X | Punto Y |
|---------|---------|
| A       | B       |
| ...     | ...     |
